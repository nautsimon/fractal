# Fractal - my first coding project
![img1](https://github.com/simonmahns/fractal/blob/master/img/img1.jpg?raw=true)


This program is a easy to use mandelbrot/julia set renderer that utilizes matplotlib.
The plot is embedded in a tkinter GUI in order to provide a easy, navigable interface for the user
(written in python)

- Save your image

- Plug in your own coordinates

- 9 color schemes to choose from (many more can be added)


This is my first ever project in python and I had a lot of fun writing this program. This was also my first time using github.

Cleaner code will be coming soon...
