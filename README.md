# fractal
This program is a easy to use mandelbrot renderer that utilizes matplotlib to plot this beautiful fractal
The plot is embedded in a tkinter GUI in order to provide a easy, navigable interface for the user
(written in python)
Save your image
Plug in your own coordinates
9 color schemes to choose from (many more can be added)

NAVIGATION (zoom around the fractals with your keyboard!):

wasd: mandelbrot nav
q: zoom (mandelbrot)
r: return to default veiw (mandelbrot)

arrow keys: julia set nav
x: zoom (julia)
return: return to default veiw (julia)

This is my first significant project in python and I had a lot of fun writing this program. This was also my first time using github, so that's why have bad documentation.

Cleaner code will be coming soon...
